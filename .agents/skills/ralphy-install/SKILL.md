description: >
  Bootstrap the ralphy CLI on a fresh machine — install the standalone binary
  from GitHub Releases, run the interactive setup wizard, and link it to the
  user's local project. Invoke proactively when the user says "install ralphy",
  "set this up from scratch", "fresh machine", "/ralphy-install", or when
  `which ralphy` returns nothing in a session that's about to use ralphy
  commands. This is the install layer; once ralphy is in PATH and the project
  is linked, hand off to /ralph-core for in-tree dev tasks.

# ralphy-install

The very first skill a new user hits. It gets the `ralphy` binary onto their
machine, makes sure `bun` and `ffmpeg` are present (the few dependencies that
the bundled binary doesn't ship), runs the interactive setup wizard for keys
and profiles, and points ralphy at their checkout of `ugc-cli`.

After this skill runs, the user can do `ralphy <anything>` from any directory.

## When to invoke me

- User says: "install ralphy", "set this up", "fresh machine", "nothing works",
  "/ralphy-install".
- `which ralphy` returns nothing.
- `ralphy status` errors with "Could not locate the ugc-cli project".

## Sub-tasks

### 1. `check-environment`

Run these once and report:

```bash
which bun || echo "MISSING: bun"
which ffmpeg || echo "MISSING: ffmpeg"
which ralphy || echo "MISSING: ralphy"
```

Decide the next step from the result:
- `bun` missing → run `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash` (in current
  shell so the user keeps running). Source the shell rc afterward.
- `ffmpeg` missing → on macOS, `brew install ffmpeg`. On Linux, suggest the
  distro's package manager.
- `ralphy` missing → `install-ralphy`.

### 2. `install-ralphy`

Run the install script from the repo:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleksei-oleinik/ugc-cli/main/install.sh | sh
```

This:
- Detects OS / arch (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64,
  windows-x64).
- Resolves the latest GitHub Release tag.
- Downloads the matching binary into `$HOME/.local/bin/ralphy`.
- Prints a PATH hint if `~/.local/bin` is not in `PATH`.

If the script reports "no published release" (the repo is fresh / private),
fall back to:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleksei-oleinik/ugc-cli.git ~/code/ugc-cli
cd ~/code/ugc-cli
bun install
bun run build:bin -- --current
cp dist/binaries/ralphy-* ~/.local/bin/ralphy
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ralphy
```

Confirm with `ralphy --version` and `which ralphy`.

### 3. `run-setup-wizard`

Once `ralphy` is in PATH:

```bash
ralphy setup
```

This is an interactive `@clack/prompts` wizard that:
- Auto-detects the project directory (walks up from cwd, then
  `~/.config/ralphy/config.json`, then `RALPHY_PROJECT_DIR`).
- Asks for the project path if it can't find one, and saves the link to the
  global config.
- Shows a status table of currently-set keys.
- Lets the user multi-select providers and prompts for each missing key, with
  a live API ping to verify.
- Offers to import any public profiles from `profiles/`.
- Optionally launches Remotion Studio + dashboard in the background.

The user drives the wizard interactively — don't try to run it
non-interactively. If you need to script it (e.g. for CI), use the underlying
flags: `ralphy setup --link <path>`, `ralphy setup --status`.

### 4. `verify`

After the wizard:

```bash
ralphy status -p
```

This prints which capabilities are enabled grouped by category. Report the
result back to the user. If `image-fal`, `voiceover-elevenlabs`, and at least
one `llm-*` are green, the core pipeline works.

Then suggest a concrete next step depending on what's enabled:
- All green → "Try `ralphy template list` to see what you can build."
- Missing keys → "Re-run `ralphy setup` to add the rest, or skip — degrades
  gracefully."

## Notes

- This skill is non-destructive. The wizard never overwrites a key without
  asking, and `--overwrite` is required for profile imports that would replace
  files.
- For in-tree development on the project itself (running `bun run dev`,
  editing components, debugging the pipeline), hand off to `/ralph-core`.
- The Vercel AI Gateway key (`VERCEL_AI_GATEWAY_KEY`) is the recommended LLM
  provider — one key unlocks Gemini, Claude, GPT, and embeddings via a
  unified gateway. OpenRouter and OpenAI are accepted fallbacks, picked
  automatically by `cli/lib/providers/llm.ts`.
- Why not a Homebrew tap yet: we ship via GitHub Releases first; brew tap
  comes later once the release cadence is stable.
